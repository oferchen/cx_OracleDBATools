cx_OracleDBATools
-----------------

This project contains a number of Python scripts that handle Oracle DBA tasks
in a cross platform manner. These scripts are intended to work the same way on
all platforms and hide the complexities involved in managing Oracle databases
on Windows. Each of these scripts is self documented by the --help or -h
option. Additional documentation can be found in the file
cx_OracleDBATools.html.

This project depends on the cx_PyGenLib, cx_Logging and cx_Oracle projects.
These must be installed before using these scripts if you are running from
source. If you are using the binary version, these projects can be safely
ignored. The binary versions of these tools were built with cx_Freeze. These
projects can be found at

cx_Freeze at http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net
cx_Logging at http://cx-logging.sourceforge.net
cx_Oracle at http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net
cx_PyGenLib at http://cx-pygenlib.sourceforge.net
