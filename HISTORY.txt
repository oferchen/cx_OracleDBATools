Changes from 3.0b1 to 3.0
 1) Added support for Oracle 11.x.
 2) Removed support for Oracle 8.x and Oracle 9.x which are no longer supported
    by Oracle.
 3) Write all SQL used for creating or restoring the database to the file
    system to allow for manual recovery in case of failures.
 4) Added new script for exporting the parameter file as a means of testing
    the contents of the generated parameter file or for seeing the contents of
    the stored parameter file if one is being used.
 5) Fixed handling of parameter log_archive_duplex_dest.
 6) Fixed hanlding of parameters with a blank value.
 7) Workaround bug in Python on Linux where os.waitpid() results in an OS error
    about no child processes.
 8) Make source compatible with Python 3.x without losing compatibility with
    Python 2.x.

Changes from 2.2 to 3.0b1
 1) Changed backup and restore to use RMAN which allows for backups while the
    database is running. The backup utility can now create directories,
    uncompressed tar files or tar files compressed with either gzip or bzip2
    as desired. Server parameter files (spfiles) and password files are now
    backed up correctly.
 2) Added support for Oracle 11g.
 3) On Windows, configuration is now read from the service directly and the
    situation where the database is configured to start when the service
    starts is now handled correctly.
 4) Created build configuration script using the new version of cx_Freeze
    which allows for building installer images on Windows and RPM packages on
    Linux.
 5) Added documentation.
 6) The cx_Logging module is now used for all logging instead of simply being
    printed to stdout or stderr.

Changes from 2.1 to 2.2
 1) Added option --replace-existing to CloneDB in order to support issuing one
    command to replace an existing database with a copy of another one.
 2) Always set the enviroment, even when connecting directly using cx_Oracle,
    as otherwise the wrong SID could be set and the wrong action take place.
 3) Do not prompt for the value for ORACLE_HOME if the --no-prompts option has
    been invoked.
 4) Increase the size of the template system tablespace for Oracle 10g as it
    was too small.
 5) On Windows, wait until the service is actually started or stopped before
    continuing.

Changes from 2.0 to 2.1
 1) Added support for Oracle 10g.
 2) Enhanced CreateDB to treat all unknown keys in each database type section
    of the configuration file and additional parameters after the SID on the 
    command line as user specified parameters that will be used when doing
    the substitution in the template init.ora, template creation sql, and 
    the template directory files.
 3) Enhanced ExportControlFile to include the current archive log mode so when 
    the control file is recreated, it will be the same.
 4) Enhanced BackupDB to allow lower level compression by adding the --compress
    option.
 5) Enhanced RestoreDB to display information about a backup file without
    having to restore the database by adding the options --info (prints
    summary information) and --list (lists all files in the backup).
 6) Enhanced RestoreDB to allow the changing of ORACLE_HOME when restoring a
    database as a different SID.
 7) Enhanced StartDB to allow restarting the database if it is already started
    by adding the options --restart and --shutdown-mode.
 8) Enhanced RestoreDB to remove an existing database if desired by adding the
    options --replace-existing, --tnsentry and --sys-password.
 9) Added simple script which examines the memory maps on Linux to determine
    how much shared/private/mapped memory is in use. The output of this script
    is still less than useful for the shared and mapped memory.
10) Stopped backing up temporary files since they can be rebuilt faster upon
    restore.
11) Fixed the problem of backing up the same directory twice under file
    systems that are not case sensitive.
12) Fixed parsing of the log_archive_dest parameter.
13) Removed restriction on the new directory being different from the old one
    when performing a restore so that restoring to the same location on a
    different machine is possible.
14) Put password in quotes in the templates so that it does not have to follow
    Oracle naming conventions.
15) Added parameter db_cache_size as another size parameter.
16) Split the template OracleControl.ini into files for Windows and files for
    Unix type machines.

Changes from 1.2 to 2.0
 1) Added tool ExportControlFile to create a file containing the statements
    necessary for recreating a control file. This file is similar to the one
    created by the statement "alter database backup controlfile to trace" but
    it allows you to specify the file name and it also modifies the statements
    output such that recreating the controlfile is possible without any
    changes.
 2) Added tool CloneDB to clone a database. This tool copies all of the files
    associated with the database and then creates a new control file and
    starts the cloned database.
 3) Added tool BackupDB to perform a cold backup on a database.
 4) Added tool RestoreDB to restore a database from a backup performed by the
    tool BackupDB. This tool can also be used to restore a database with a
    different SID and different paths so that a backup file can be restored on
    a different machine so long as the platform and Oracle version remain
    constant.
 5) Added tool RemoveDB to remove a database completely from the machine.
 6) Added option --all to StartDB and StopDB to start or stop all databases on
    the machine.
 7) Added option --all-auto to StartDB to start all databases marked as
    automatic start (similar to the Oracle script dbstart on Unix).
 8) Added ability to StartDB and StopDB to start or stop multiple databases at
    once.
 9) Added option --shutdown-mode to StopDB to allow for issuing a shutdown
    abort, for example.
10) Added option --config-file-name on all tools to allow overriding the
    configuration file name and also give an indication of where the default
    configuration file is located.

Changes for 1.2
 1) First introduced to the public.
